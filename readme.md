## Very simple ext2 file system
All implemented features on [x2.h](https://github.com/nturume/x2/blob/main/x2.h).

Check [example.c](https://github.com/nturume/x2/blob/main/example.c) and [test.sh](https://github.com/nturume/x2/blob/main/test.sh) for usage.

Fuse3 interface is also implemented at [fuse.cpp](https://github.com/nturume/x2/blob/main/fuse.cpp) and [fuse.sh](https://github.com/nturume/x2/blob/main/fuse.sh) 
Code review is much welcome.
